 <b>Project management</b> 
 is the process of leading the work of a

 to achieve all project goals within the given constraints.
 This information is usually described in 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_initiation_documentation" title="Project initiation documentation">project documentation</a>, 
 created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints are

<p>The objective of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the client's objectives. 
In many cases, the objective of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief to feasibly 
address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established, they should influence all 
decisions made by other people involved in the project&nbsp;â€“ for example, project managers, designers, contractors, 
and subcontractors. Ill-defined or too tightly prescribed project management objectives are detrimental to

is a temporary and unique endeavor designed to produce a product, service, or result with a defined beginning 
and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or staffing) undertaken to meet unique goals 
and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.
The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with

which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services.
